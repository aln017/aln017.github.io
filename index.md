## About Me

I am currently a 2nd year Computer Science student at UCSD. I have aspirations to become a programmer or software developer.

**My current favorite programming language is C++.**

*I would like to learn JavaScript in the near future.*

John F. Kennedy once said:

> Those who dare to fail miserably can achieve greatly.

Therefore we must be willing to make mistakes before we can make great achievements.

def access():
    creds = None;

    if os.path.exists('token.pkl'):
        with open('token.pkl', 'rb') as token:
            creds = pickle.load(token)
```


2. BitCoin Tracker
