### About Me

I am currently a 2nd year Computer Science student at UCSD. I have aspirations to become a programmer or software developer.

**My current favorite programming language is C++.**

*I would like to learn JavaScript in the near future.*

> Those who dare to fail miserably can achieve greatly.

Therefore we must be willing to make mistakes before we can make great achievements.
